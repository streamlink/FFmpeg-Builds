====

This is a fork of [`BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds`](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) with modifications
of the build and deploy config.

The goal of this fork is to have both win32+win64 builds of FFmpeg for inclusion in [Streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink)'s [Windows installers and Windows portable builds](https://github.com/streamlink/windows-builds).

Please see the upstream readme for more information.
