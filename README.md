streamlink/FFmpeg-Builds
====

This is a fork of [`BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds`](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) with modifications
of the build and deploy config.

The goal of this fork is to have Windows and Linux builds of FFmpeg on `x86_64` and `aarch64` for inclusion in [Streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink)'s [Windows installers and Windows portable builds](https://github.com/streamlink/windows-builds) and [Linux AppImages](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-appimage).

Please see the [upstream readme](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
